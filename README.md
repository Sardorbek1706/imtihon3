# Product Catalog API (Scaffold)

This archive contains a scaffold for a Product Catalog application using:

- Express.js
- EJS for views
- Knex.js + PostgreSQL for database
- JWT based auth (placeholders included)

Notes:
- This scaffold intentionally contains placeholders (no example implementations).
- Implement controllers, middleware and routes according to your needs.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure DATABASE_URL and secrets.
- Use `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run migrate` for migrations (after creating them).
